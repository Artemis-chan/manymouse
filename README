This is a simple library to abstract away the reading of multiple input
 devices. It is designed to work cross-platform.

Just copy all of the C files and headers in this directory into your
 project and build; for basic use, you shouldn't have to #define anything,
 and each file is wrapped in #ifdefs to avoid compiling on the wrong
 platforms. For more complex use (such as using the X11 XInput extension),
 you will need to define some things.

To use:
 - #include "manymouse.h" in your source code
 - Call ManyMouse_Init(); if it returns > 0, it found mice it can use.
 - Call ManyMouse_DeviceName() if you want to know the human-readable
   name of each device ("Logitech USB mouse", etc).
 - Read input from the mice with ManyMouse_PollEvent() in a loop until the
   function returns 0. Each time through the loop, example the event that
   was returned and react appropriately.
 - When you are done, call ManyMouse_Quit().

There are examples of complete usage in the "example" directory.

Some notes:
 - If a mouse is disconnected, it will not return future events, even if you
   plug it right back in. You will be alerted of disconnects programmatically
   through the MANYMOUSE_EVENT_DISCONNECT event, which will be the last
   event sent for the disconnected device. You can safely redetect all mice by
   calling ManyMouse_Quit() followed by ManyMouse_Init(), but be warned that
   this may cause mice (even ones that weren't unplugged) to suddenly have a
   different device index. It is recommended that you make redetection an
   explicit user-requested function for this reason.

 - In most systems, all mice will control the same system cursor. It's
   recommended that you ask your Window system to grab the mouse input and
   hide the system cursor, and then do all mouse input processing through
   ManyMouse. Most GUI systems will continue to deliver mouse events through
   the system cursor even when ManyMouse is working; in these cases, you
   should continue to read the usual GUI system event queue, and just throw
   away the mouse events.
